# ProductInventorySystem
ProductInventorySystem is a console-based application developed in C# (.NET) focused on clean architecture, separation of concerns, and safe data persistence.  The system allows users to add, list, and retrieve products, with data persisted in a JSON file. Data is loaded once at application startup and saved only when changes occur, preventing data loss and unnecessary file reads.  The project follows a clear architectural structure, separating Models, Services, and UI (Program.cs) responsibilities. All business rules and data/file handling are centralized in the Service layer, while the user interface is responsible only for input and output.  Key features include:  JSON-based data persistence  Inventory management using Dictionary for efficient lookups  Business rule validation inside the Service layer  Proper exception handling without breaking the application  Automatic creation of required files and directories  Clean and maintainable code, ready for future extensions (API or database integration)  This project was built to practice real-world development patterns and to simulate a production-like environment expected from a Junior Software Developer.
